# Power-BI-covid-nigeria-dashboard
Find attached the files that I used for the analysis and visualization 
"Built a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize the impact of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

Process:

Cleaned and transformed messy, real-world data in Excel (fixed mixed date formats using 'Text to Columns').

Summarized state-level data using Pivot Tables.

Built the dashboard in Power BI, creating a live map visual, time-series line chart, and interactive summary cards.

Tools: Power BI, Excel, Power Query, Pivot Tables"
## The Goal

"My goal was to use my new data analysis skills to analyze a real-world dataset and create a user-friendly dashboard. I chose a public health dataset to align with my background in biochemistry."

## The Process & Tools

Mention the tools: Excel, Power BI (Power Query).

## The Challenge: Dirty Data

This is the most important part. Show them you're a problem-solver.

"The raw data was very dirty. The date column had two different formats mixed together: text (like 16/03/2020) and Excel serial numbers (like 43833)."

"My first attempts to load this in Power BI caused DataFormat.Error."

## The Solution

"I solved this by using Excel's 'Text to Columns' feature to force all cells into a single, clean 'DMY' date format. This fixed the dataset before loading it, which is best practice."

"I also used Power Query to filter out the 'Grand Total' row from the Pivot Table, which was incorrectly appearing on the map in the United States."
